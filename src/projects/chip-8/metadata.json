    "subDescription": "A low-level systems project that involved implementing the full instruction set of the CHIP-8 virtual machine, including memory management, register simulation, timers, and display handling using SDL2. The emulator supports loading and running original CHIP-8 ROMs and renders the display at 60Hz. It was a hands-on experience in decoding binary opcodes, managing emulated hardware, and integrating audio/keyboard I/O. This project improved my debugging skills and reinforced my understanding of CPU architecture and binary-level computation.",
